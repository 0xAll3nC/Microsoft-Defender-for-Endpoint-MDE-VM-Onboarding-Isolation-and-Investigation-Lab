# 🛡️ Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) – VM Onboarding, Isolation, and Investigation Lab

This project demonstrates a realistic incident response workflow using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE). It guides you through onboarding a virtual machine to MDE, isolating it in response to a threat, and collecting forensic investigation data.

Ideal for security engineers, blue teamers, or students looking to simulate real-world endpoint detection and response (EDR) processes in a safe lab environment.
